# HotHotHot
Plays HotHotHot sound when getting killed by Fire

## Important: This mod does not play well along with the halo announcer!!
This mod overrides the same function which halo announcer uses for the kill streaks.

If you want to use this mod on top of halo announcer (almost everything will be broken). Increase the `"LoadPriority": 2`, in the mod.json to higher value as halo announcer e.g.: 5.
